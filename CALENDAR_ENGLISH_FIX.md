# Calendar Language Fix - Changed to English

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Date Picker Component** (`src/components/ui/date-picker.tsx`)
- Changed locale from `zhCN` (Chinese) to `enUS` (English)
- Updated all Chinese comments to English
- Fixed placeholder text from "选择日期" to "Select date"

### 2. **Amount Input Component** (`src/components/ui/amount-input.tsx`)
- Translated all Chinese comments to English
- No functional changes, just documentation improvements

### 3. **Date Picker Test Page** (`src/pages/DatePickerTestPage.tsx`)
- Translated all Chinese UI text to English:
  - "稳定版日期选择器" → "Stable Date Picker"
  - "已实现的功能" → "Implemented Features"
  - "默认样式" → "Default Style"
  - "选择日期" → "Select date"
  - "未选择" → "Not selected"
  - Date format changed from 'zh-CN' to 'en-US'

## 📅 Calendar Display

The calendar component now shows:
- **Weekdays**: M, T, W, T, F, S, S (English abbreviations)
- **Month names**: January, February, March, etc. (in English)
- **Date format**: MM/DD/YYYY (US format) or can be customized

## 🔄 Impact

All date pickers throughout the application will now display in English:
- Project creation/editing forms
- Staff scheduling calendars
- Expense claim date fields
- Payment submission dates
- Task due dates

## 💡 How It Works

The fix was applied at the component level, so all instances of `DatePicker` automatically use English:

```tsx
// Before (Chinese)
import { zhCN } from "date-fns/locale"
locale = zhCN

// After (English)
import { enUS } from "date-fns/locale"
locale = enUS
```

## ✨ No Additional Changes Needed

Since the fix was applied at the base component level, all calendar instances throughout the app automatically display in English now. No need to update individual pages or forms.
