## Critical Findings (Pre-Test)

### HIGH PRIORITY FIXES REQUIRED
1. ‚ùå **Schema Bugs**: Using wrong column names (`name` vs `full_name`)
2. ‚ùå **Unimplemented Features**: Scheduling conflicts returns empty
3. ‚ùå **Missing Date Filters**: Revenue calculation ignores date ranges
4. ‚ùå **No Multi-Tool Chaining**: Can't perform multi-step operations
5. ‚ùå **No Context Memory**: Forgets previous queries immediately

### MEDIUM PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Tools**: Only 5 tools (need 15-20 for full functionality)
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Proactive Suggestions**: Doesn't anticipate user needs
8. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Generic Responses**: Doesn't explain reasoning
9. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Learning**: Can't adapt to user preferences
10. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Basic Analytics**: Can't derive insights from data
