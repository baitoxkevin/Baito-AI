# Improved Logo Search Function

## Summary of Enhancements

The logo search function has been significantly improved to better handle smaller brands and local businesses that may not have standard `.com` domains.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Brand Name Normalization
- Automatically removes common company suffixes (Sdn, Bhd, Ltd, Inc, Corp, LLC, etc.)
- Removes regional prefixes (PT, CV for Indonesian companies)
- This helps find logos for companies like "ABC Sdn Bhd" by searching for "ABC"

### 2. Enhanced Google Favicon Search
- Now uses multiple search patterns with Google's favicon service
- Searches for:
  - Brand name alone
  - Brand + "official"
  - Brand + "company"
  - Brand + "logo"
  - Brand + "website"
- This mimics how Google search often finds the correct favicon from sponsored results

### 3. Expanded TLD Support
- Added support for many more top-level domains beyond .com:
  - Generic: .net, .org, .co, .io, .app, .ai, .dev, .tech, .store, .shop
  - Regional: .my, .sg, .uk, .au, .id, .th, .ph (and their .com.* variants)
- Tries multiple TLD combinations for each brand

### 4. Better Multi-word Brand Handling
- Automatically tries both space-separated and hyphenated versions
- Example: "Tech Solutions" tries both "techsolutions.com" and "tech-solutions.com"

### 5. Additional Logo Sources
- Added PNGFind as an alternative logo source
- Maintains all existing sources (Brandfetch, Logo.dev, Uplead, Clearbit)
- Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons for well-known brands

### 6. Improved Fallback Handling
- Generated SVG logo now appears earlier in results (3rd position)
- Provides immediate visual feedback while other logos load
- Uses attractive colors and clean design

## Usage Tips

1. **For Local Businesses**: Enter just the brand name without suffixes
   - ✅ "TechVenture" instead of "TechVenture Sdn Bhd"
   - ✅ "Digital Solutions" instead of "PT Digital Solutions"

2. **For Smaller Brands**: The system will now:
   - Try multiple domain variations automatically
   - Use Google's search-based favicon finding
   - Provide a nice generated logo as fallback

3. **Manual Search**: If automatic search doesn't find the right logo:
   - Click "Search Google Images" button in the selector
   - Find the logo manually and paste the URL
   - Or upload a local file

## Technical Details

The `fetchMultipleBrandLogos` function in `/src/lib/logo-service.ts` now:
1. Normalizes brand names before searching
2. Tries multiple API endpoints with various name formats
3. Uses fuzzy matching where possible
4. Returns results ordered by likelihood of correctness
5. Always provides at least one option (generated logo)

This should significantly improve logo discovery for Malaysian and other regional businesses that don't follow standard naming conventions.
