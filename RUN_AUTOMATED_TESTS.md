## 🐛 If Tests Fail

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: Cannot find chatbot widget**
```
Solution: Update selector in puppeteer-chatbot-test.js:
const selectors = [
  'your-actual-chatbot-button-selector'
];
```

**Issue 2: Login required**
```
Solution: The script will pause and ask you to login manually.
Just login in the browser window, then press Enter in terminal.
```

**Issue 3: Response timeout**
```
Solution: Increase timeout in CONFIG:
TIMEOUT: 30000  // 30 seconds
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit `puppeteer-chatbot-test.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  APP_URL: 'http://localhost:5173',
  HEADLESS: false,  // Set to true for faster testing
  SLOW_MO: 50,      // Slow down for visibility
  TIMEOUT: 30000,   // 30 seconds
  WAIT_BETWEEN_TESTS: 2000  // 2 seconds between tests
};
```

---

## 📈 Intelligence Score Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Intelligence Score = (Passed Tests / Total Tests) * 100
```

**Grade Scale:**
- 90-100: Grade A (Excellent)
- 80-89: Grade B (Good)
- 70-79: Grade C (Fair)
- 60-69: Grade D (Poor)
- <60: Grade F (Fail)

**Current Target:** 85/100 (Grade A-)

# Open this file and copy-paste queries:
open QUICK_TEST_COMMANDS.md

# Record results here:
open LIVE_TEST_RESULTS.md
```

### Option 2: Batch Testing
```bash
# Follow step-by-step guide:
open TEST_BATCH_RUNNER.md
```
