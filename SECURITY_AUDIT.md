# Security Audit Report

## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Exposed API Keys (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Issue**: Multiple API keys were exposed in `.mcp.json` and `mcp.json` files that were tracked in git
**Impact**: These keys could be used by attackers to:
- Access your Supabase database (sbp_8a5d6de3b1c2d8c989be89d41829543c168d9e2c)
- Use your 21st.dev API quota (617d2248835f7742fb97cb1c0e417aeed44ad4a33d871e8e65540879b876b5e2)
- Use your Google API services (AIzaSyAUzT3o4vg-Htn-l_rd_JiujplI48Mjf4Q)

**Resolution**:
- Removed `.mcp.json` and `mcp.json` from git tracking
- Added these files to `.gitignore`
- Created `.mcp.json.example` template file without sensitive data

### 2. Environment Files (MEDIUM - OK)
**Status**: `.env` files are properly excluded from git via `.gitignore`
**Note**: Local `.env` files contain Supabase credentials but are not committed

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Rotate Compromised Keys (URGENT)
Since these keys were exposed in git history, you MUST:

1. **Supabase Access Token**: 
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
   - Revoke the exposed token: `sbp_8a5d6de3b1c2d8c989be89d41829543c168d9e2c`
   - Generate a new access token

2. **21st.dev API Key**:
   - Visit your 21st.dev account settings
   - Regenerate your API key
   - The exposed key `617d2248835f7742fb97cb1c0e417aeed44ad4a33d871e8e65540879b876b5e2` should be invalidated

3. **Google API Key**:
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   - Delete or regenerate the exposed key: `AIzaSyAUzT3o4vg-Htn-l_rd_JiujplI48Mjf4Q`
   - Add IP/domain restrictions to the new key

### 2. Clean Git History
The exposed keys are still in your git history. To completely remove them:

```bash
# Use BFG Repo-Cleaner or git filter-branch to remove sensitive data
# Option 1: Using BFG (recommended)
brew install bfg
bfg --delete-files .mcp.json
bfg --delete-files mcp.json
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Option 2: Force push a new branch without the sensitive commits
# This is more drastic but ensures complete removal
```

### 3. Update Local Configuration
After getting new keys:
1. Copy `.mcp.json.example` to `.mcp.json`
2. Replace placeholder values with your new keys
3. Never commit `.mcp.json` to git

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Use Environment Variables**: Store all sensitive keys in environment variables
2. **Use Secret Management**: Consider using a secret management service
3. **Regular Audits**: Periodically scan for exposed secrets using tools like:
   - `gitleaks`
   - `trufflehog`
   - GitHub secret scanning

4. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Add pre-commit hooks to prevent committing secrets:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev husky
   npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx gitleaks detect --verbose --redact"
   ```

## Additional Observations

- Console.log statements have been properly removed (good security practice)
- The `.gitignore` file is comprehensive but needed updates for MCP files
- No other hardcoded secrets found in the source code

## Status
✅ Immediate threats removed from working directory
⚠️ Keys need rotation (exposed in git history)
⚠️ Git history needs cleaning
