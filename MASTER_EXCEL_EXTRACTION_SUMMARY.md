# Master Excel Extraction Summary - V2 Enhanced

## üìä Overview

Successfully created an enhanced master Excel file extracting **comprehensive candidate payment data** from 20 CSV files (Baito April 2025 payment details).

**Output File:** `master_candidate_data_v2.xlsx`

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed/Enhanced

### 1. **Zero Payment Issue - SOLVED** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Some projects showed `RM 0.00` total payment
**Root Cause:** CSV files had "Wages" column but no "Total" or "Payment" column
**Solution:** Calculate total by summing wages + OT + allowance + claim when "Total" column is missing
**Result:** Only 1/201 records with zero payment (down from 3)
**Payment Impact:** Total increased from RM 52,545 ‚Üí **RM 67,075** (+RM 14,530 recovered!)

### 2. **Account Numbers Extraction - FIXED** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Account numbers weren't being extracted (showed 0%)
**Root Cause:** Column name filtering was too restrictive
**Solution:** Enhanced column detection to find "Bank Account" columns
**Result:** 199/201 (99%) now have account numbers

### 3. **Project Metadata Extraction** ‚úÖ
**New Fields Added:**
- **project_date_range**: "12 March - 6 April", "20th April 2025", etc.
- **payment_due_date**: "Payment by 5 May", "21", "2025-03-21"
- **location**: Venue names, addresses
- **time_schedule**: Work hours (e.g., "10am - 6pm (call time 9am)")

**Coverage:**
- 92/201 (46%) have payment due dates
- Varies by project format

### 4. **Work Schedule & Dates** ‚úÖ
**Extracted:**
- Specific work dates per candidate
- Days worked count
- Date ranges for multi-day projects

### 5. **Roster/Team Information** ‚úÖ
**What Was Captured:**
- 100/201 records (50%) have roster info
- Shows who worked together on specific dates
- Extracted from date column headers

**Example:**
```
2025-04-11: YI KHANG, Wei Shan, Fatihah
2025-04-12: Same team
```

### 6. **Notes & Side Notes** ‚úÖ
**Categories:**
- **project_notes**: "Sammy Claim", payment method notes
- **notes**: Personal notes like "from laili", "1.30pm", "fren fren", "OTS"
- 46/201 records have notes

### 7. **Alternate Names** ‚úÖ
**Extracted names in parentheses:**
- Main: "Leo Kit Yi" ‚Üí Alternate: "Cheah Cheu Peng"
- Main: "Puteri Diana" ‚Üí Alternate: "Muhammad Musa Kazhim Bin Indramawan"

## üöÄ Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ‚úÖ **Review** `master_candidate_data_v2.xlsx` - verify data accuracy
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Fix zero payment** - check Ribena Raya project for Muhd Firdaus
3. üìù **Manual review** - "Sammy Claim" entries (internal process?)

### Future Enhancements:

#### 1. **Account Holder Name Detection**
```
Current: account_holder_name = NULL (placeholder column exists)
Goal: Extract if bank account is under family/friend name
Method: Could prompt for manual entry or extract from additional notes
```

#### 2. **Process Full Year Data**
```

-- Suggested table structure:
candidates (
  ic_number PRIMARY KEY,
  full_name, bank_name, account_number,
  account_holder_name, created_at, updated_at
)

candidate_projects (
  id PRIMARY KEY,
  ic_number FK,
  project_id FK,
  days_worked, total_payment,
  work_dates, position,
  payment_due_date, notes
)

projects (
  id PRIMARY KEY,
  project_name, project_date_range,
  location, company (Baito/Zenevento),
  total_budget, total_candidates
)
```

#### 4. **Data Cleanup Scripts**
- Normalize bank names (e.g., "maybank" vs "Maybank" vs "MAYBANK")
- Detect duplicate candidates (same person, different spellings)
- Validate IC numbers (format checking)
- Flag unusual payment amounts

#### 5. **Analytics Dashboard**
- Top earners
- Most active candidates
- Payment trends over time
- Popular locations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

### Column Detection Algorithm:
```python
# Smart column identification handles:
- Multiple header rows per file
- Varying column names across projects
- Missing columns (optional fields)
- Date columns as roster info
- Notes scattered across unnamed columns
```

### Data Cleaning:
- IC numbers: Remove hyphens, spaces, handle multi-line entries
- Names: Capitalize properly, extract alternates from parentheses
- Account numbers: Convert from scientific notation, clean formatting
- Amounts: Safe float conversion, handle empty cells

### Edge Cases Handled:
‚úÖ Multi-section CSVs (multiple projects per file)
‚úÖ Continuation rows (same candidate across multiple rows)
‚úÖ Missing "Total" column (calculate from components)
‚úÖ Date columns used for roster (not payment dates)
‚úÖ Notes in unnamed columns
‚úÖ Special characters in names/locations
