# Security Policy

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
**CRITICAL**: Never commit `.env` files or API keys to version control.

#### What NOT to commit:
- `.env` files
- API keys (OpenRouter, Supabase, etc.)
- Service role keys
- Access tokens
- Database credentials

#### Best Practices:
1. Always use `.env.example` as a template (without real credentials)
2. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already configured)
3. Store production secrets in Netlify environment variables
4. Rotate keys immediately if accidentally exposed

### If You Accidentally Expose an API Key

1. **Immediately rotate the key** at the service provider:
   - OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai/keys
   - Supabase: Project Settings ‚Üí API
   
2. **Remove from Git history**:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached .env
   git commit -m "security: remove exposed credentials"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Update all applications** using the old key

### Deployment Security

#### Netlify Environment Variables
Set these in: Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables

Required variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

Never hardcode these in your application code!

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email: [your-security-email]

Do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.
