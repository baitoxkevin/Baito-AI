# Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-deployment Steps Completed

1. **Security**
   - [x] Added .env to .gitignore
   - [x] Created .env.example template
   - [x] No hardcoded API keys or secrets found
   - [x] Supabase anon key is properly stored in environment variable

2. **Build Configuration**
   - [x] Netlify configuration updated with security headers
   - [x] Build command specified: `npm run build`
   - [x] Node version set to 18
   - [x] SPA redirects configured

3. **Development Testing**
   - [x] Development server runs successfully on port 5174
   - [x] Supabase connection verified (project: BaitoAI, region: us-east-1)
   - [x] Database status: ACTIVE_HEALTHY

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **TypeScript Errors**: ~700 type errors remain, mostly from:
   - Database schema mismatches
   - Complex query type inference
   - RPC function calls need type assertions

2. **ESLint Warnings**: ~1000+ warnings for:
   - Unused variables
   - Missing dependencies in hooks
   - Any types

These don't prevent the app from running but should be addressed post-deployment.

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### For Netlify:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. Deploy (Netlify will use the netlify.toml configuration)

### For Vercel:
1. Import project from GitHub
2. Set environment variables
3. Framework preset: Vite
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Output directory: `dist`

### For Manual Deployment:
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# The 'dist' folder contains your static files
# Upload to any static hosting service
```

## üìã Post-deployment Tasks

1. **Test Critical Flows**:
   - User authentication
   - Project creation/editing
   - Candidate management
   - Expense claims
   - Document uploads

2. **Monitor**:
   - Check browser console for runtime errors
   - Monitor Supabase dashboard for API usage
   - Check error logs

3. **Performance**:
   - Enable caching headers
   - Consider CDN for static assets
   - Monitor bundle size

## üîí Security Reminders

1. Ensure Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies are enabled
2. Review database permissions
3. Set up proper CORS policies if needed
4. Consider enabling Supabase Auth rate limiting

## üìù Notes

- The app uses Supabase for backend (database + auth)
- Static file hosting is sufficient (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- No server-side rendering required
- All API calls go through Supabase client SDK
