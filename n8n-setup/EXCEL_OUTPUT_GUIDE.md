# Excel Vision Extraction - Output to Excel First

## üéØ New Approach: Vision AI ‚Üí Excel Review ‚Üí Database

Instead of directly inserting to Supabase, we now:
1. ‚úÖ Use Vision AI to understand each table
2. ‚úÖ Extract with deep reasoning about merged cells, continuations, summaries
3. ‚úÖ Output to Excel for human review
4. ‚úÖ Then import to Supabase after approval

## üß† How the Reasoning Model Works

### Stage 1: Identify Structure (GPT-4 Vision)
Analyzes the Excel screenshot and identifies:
- Table type (personal info, payment data, mixed)
- Header row location and all column names
- Merged cell locations and their span
- Summary/subtotal row locations
- Multiple sections within one sheet
- Data quality issues

**Output:** Structured JSON with table metadata

### Stage 2: Extract with Reasoning (GPT-4 Vision)
For EACH row, the model reasons:
- ‚ùì Is this a data row, continuation row, or summary row?
- ‚ùì Which candidate does this belong to?
- ‚ùì Is this adding new info or continuing from merged cell above?
- ‚ùì What does each cell value mean in context?

**Handles:**
- ‚úÖ Merged cells ‚Üí Groups continuation rows with parent
- ‚úÖ Ambiguous columns ‚Üí Determines "Payment" vs "Total" meaning
- ‚úÖ Days > 50 ‚Üí Recognizes as payment amount, not days
- ‚úÖ Summary rows ‚Üí Excludes "Total", "Grand Total", "Subtotal"
- ‚úÖ Roster sections ‚Üí Skips rows with Name but no IC
- ‚úÖ Payment logic ‚Üí Sums Wages+OT+Allowance+Claims correctly

**Output:** Array of candidate records (not individual rows)

### Stage 3: Validate & Review (GPT-4)
Cross-checks extracted data:
- ‚úÖ IC numbers unique? (duplicates = failed merging)
- ‚úÖ Payment calculations correct?
- ‚úÖ Account numbers clean (no .0)?
- ‚úÖ Totals match summary rows in Excel?
- ‚úÖ Any suspicious data (Names="Total", Days=500)?

**Output:** Validation report with issues flagged

### Stage 4: Export to Excel
Generates clean Excel file with:
- All extracted candidate records
- Source row tracking
- Confidence scores
- Reasoning explanations
- Issue flags for manual review

## üöÄ Setup

### 1. Import Workflow
```bash
# Start n8n
npx n8n

# Import workflow
# Open http://localhost:5678
# Workflows ‚Üí Import from File ‚Üí vision_to_excel_workflow.json
```

### 2. Configure OpenAI Credentials
- Settings ‚Üí Credentials ‚Üí Add OpenAI API
- Need GPT-4 Vision access
- Save as `openai_vision`

### 3. Test Single Sheet
```bash
# Take screenshot of one Excel sheet
# Run test:
node n8n-setup/test-vision-to-excel.js screenshot.png
```

---

## üì∏ Batch Processing All Excel Files

### Option 1: Manual Screenshots
```bash
# For each Excel file:
# 1. Open in Excel/Numbers/LibreOffice
# 2. Navigate to each sheet
# 3. Take screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac)
# 4. Save as: {filename}_{sheetname}.png

# Then batch process:
node n8n-setup/batch-process-screenshots.js excel_screenshots/
```

### Option 2: Automated Screenshots (Python)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install openpyxl Pillow pandas

# Generate screenshots automatically
python scripts/excel_to_screenshots.py \
  --input "excel_imports/*.xlsx" \
  --output "excel_screenshots/"

# Then process with n8n
node n8n-setup/batch-process-screenshots.js excel_screenshots/
```

### Option 3: Use Claude Vision Directly (No n8n)
```bash
# Process with Claude API
node scripts/claude-vision-extractor.js excel_screenshots/
```

## üìä Output Files

After processing, you'll get:

### 1. Individual JSON Files
```
baito_jan2025_sheet1_extracted.json
baito_jan2025_sheet2_extracted.json
...
```

### 2. Excel Output File
```
baito_extracted_2025-10-08_143022.xlsx
```

**Columns:**
- Name
- IC Number (clean, no .0)
- Phone
- Bank Name
- Account Number (string format)
- Total Days
- Wages, Overtime, Allowance, Claims
- Total Payment
- Payment Date
- Project Name
- Location
- Notes
- **Source Rows** (e.g., "2+3+4" = rows 2,3,4 merged)
- **Confidence** (high/medium/low)
- **Reasoning** (explains how data was interpreted)
- **Issues** (flags for manual review)

---

## ‚úÖ Review Process

### 1. Check Confidence Scores
```bash
# Filter low confidence records
=FILTER(A:S, Q:Q="low")
```

### 2. Review Flagged Issues
Look at **Issues** column for:
- "Possible duplicate IC"
- "Payment calculation mismatch"
- "Missing required field"
- "Unusual value (Days > 50)"

### 3. Compare with Source
Use **Source Rows** column to find original data:
- Open original Excel file
- Navigate to sheet
- Check rows listed (e.g., rows 2+3+4)
- Verify extraction is correct

### 4. Validate Totals
```bash
# Sum all payments
=SUM(K:K)

# Compare with your session summary: RM 496,606.55
```

### 5. Check for Missing Data
```bash
# Count records per month
=COUNTIF(L:L, "Jan*")  # Should match original file
```

## üîÑ Re-process Issues

If you find issues:

### 1. Adjust Prompts
Edit the workflow in n8n:
- Click "Vision 2 - Extract with Reasoning" node
- Modify the prompt to handle the specific case
- Save workflow

### 2. Re-run Failed Sheets
```bash
# Just the problematic sheet
node n8n-setup/test-vision-to-excel.js \
  excel_screenshots/baito_march_sheet5.png
```

### 3. Merge Results
```bash
# Combine all individual Excel outputs
python scripts/merge_extracted_excels.py \
  --input "baito_extracted_*.xlsx" \
  --output "baito_2025_FINAL_MASTER.xlsx"
```

## üìà Expected Improvements Over V3

| Issue | V3 Python Script | V4 Vision AI |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| Merged cells | Manual row grouping | AI understands continuations |
| Ambiguous columns | Fixed logic | Contextual reasoning |
| Summary rows | Keyword matching | Semantic understanding |
| Payment logic | If/else rules | Infers calculation method |
| Account .0 issue | Post-processing | Extracts as string directly |
| Missing data | Blind column mapping | Reads all visible data |
| Multi-section sheets | Section detection logic | Identifies boundaries visually |

**Result:** Should achieve >95% accuracy with minimal manual fixes

## üéØ Next Steps After Review

Once you've reviewed the Excel output and confirmed accuracy:

### 1. Import to Supabase
```bash
# Use the import script
node scripts/import-to-supabase.js baito_2025_FINAL_MASTER.xlsx
```

### 2. Or use the original n8n workflow
- Switch to `vision_extraction_workflow.json`
- Loads data directly to Supabase
- Includes validation step

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Vision AI misidentifies merged cells
**Fix:** Adjust prompt in "Vision 1 - Identify Structure":
```
Add this line:
"Pay special attention to cells that span multiple rows - these create continuation rows where Name/IC are empty but data continues from above."
```

### Payments still wrong
**Fix:** In "Vision 2 - Extract with Reasoning", enhance payment logic:
```
Add this section:
"PAYMENT VALIDATION: After calculating total, verify:
- If Total column exists, use it (not calculated sum)
- If only Payment column exists, use it as-is
- Cross-check: Does Wages+OT+Allowance ‚âà Total? If not, explain discrepancy in reasoning field"
```

### Too many false positives
**Fix:** Strengthen exclusion rules:
```
Add to EXCLUDE section:
"- Any row where Name contains keywords: Total, Subtotal, Grand, Sum, Pax, Team, Staff
- Any row where IC is empty AND Name is not empty (roster section)
- Any row where all payment fields are 0 AND no date field (template row)"
```
