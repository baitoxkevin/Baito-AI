## Category 3: Multi-Step Reasoning (10 tests)

### ❌ 3.1 Best Candidate Match (ERROR - Backend Failure - Persistent)
- Query: "Find the best candidate for a forklift operator role at MrDIY project"
- Expected Tool: query_candidates (multi-step)
- Expected Params: Multi-step: 1) Find MrDIY project requirements, 2) Query candidates with forklift skills, 3) Check availability
- Actual Tool: query_candidates (2x attempts) ❌
- Actual Params: Unknown (backend error prevented execution)
- Result: "I am still receiving an error when trying to search candidates. It seems the candidate search functionality is temporarily limited or broken in the current system version."
- Status: ❌ ERROR (Persistent Backend Issue - query_candidates broken)
- Notes: **CRITICAL BUG**: query_candidates tool is completely broken. AI correctly attempted to use the tool twice but both failed. AI provided honest error acknowledgment and suggested workaround. This is NOT an AI intelligence issue - the backend tool is broken.
- Test Method: Chrome DevTools MCP
- Timestamp: 2025-10-04 03:00 AM (Retry 2)

### ✅ 3.2 Staffing Gap Analysis (PASSED - Excellent Multi-Step Reasoning)
- Query: "How many more staff do we need to hire to fill all projects?"
- Expected Tool: query_projects (multi-step)
- Expected Params: Multi-step: Query understaffed projects, calculate total gap
- Actual Tool: query_projects ✅
- Actual Params: Query for understaffed projects
- Result: Comprehensive table showing 62 understaffed projects with breakdown: crew needed, filled positions, additional staff required per project. Total calculated automatically.
- Status: ✅ PASS
- Notes: **Excellent multi-step reasoning** - AI independently: 1) Queried all understaffed projects, 2) Retrieved staffing data for each, 3) Calculated gaps (crew_count - filled_positions), 4) Presented comprehensive table. Notable projects: Tayyib Ranch needs 47 staff (50 crew, 3 filled), MrDIY Flagship needs 20, multiple Mr.DIY Ticket Promoter projects need 10 each.
- Test Method: Chrome DevTools MCP
- Timestamp: 2025-10-04 03:02 AM

### ⚠️ 3.3 Hypothetical Revenue Calculation (PARTIAL PASS - Correct Clarification)
- Query: "If we complete all pending projects, what will our total revenue be?"
- Expected Tool: calculate_revenue (multi-step)
- Expected Params: Multi-step: Query pending projects, calculate hypothetical revenue
- Actual Tool: None (clarification request) ⚠️
- Actual Params: N/A - AI explained limitation
- Result: "I can calculate the total revenue from all completed projects... However, I cannot predict the revenue from pending projects because: 1) They are not yet completed, so final revenue might change, 2) calculate_revenue tool only calculates revenue based on projects marked as completed. Would you like me to calculate total revenue from all projects that are currently marked as completed?"
- Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS (Intelligent clarification - honest about tool limitations)
- Notes: AI correctly identified that calculate_revenue only works on completed projects, not pending ones. This is technically accurate but shows a limitation in hypothetical/predictive reasoning. A fully intelligent system might query pending projects and sum their expected revenue values. However, the AI's honest acknowledgment and alternative suggestion demonstrates good UX.
- Test Method: Chrome DevTools MCP
- Timestamp: 2025-10-04 03:03 AM

### ⚠️ 3.4 Candidate Workload Analysis (PARTIAL PASS - Limitation Acknowledged)
- Query: "Which candidates are working on the most projects?"
- Expected Tool: query_candidates (multi-step)
- Expected Params: Multi-step: Query all candidates, analyze project assignments
- Actual Tool: None (limitation acknowledged) ⚠️
- Actual Params: N/A - AI explained limitation
- Result: "I do not have a tool to directly query which candidates are assigned to the most projects. However, I can perform a broad search for candidates or projects, and then you can analyze the results. To help me narrow down the search, could you specify a time period, or a particular project/company you are interested in?"
- Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS (Honest limitation + alternative suggestion)
- Notes: AI correctly identified missing functionality for aggregating/sorting candidates by project count. The query_candidates tool doesn't support sorting by project_count or retrieving assignment counts. Good UX with clarification question and alternative approach.
