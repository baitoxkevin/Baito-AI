Viewport: 1920x1080
Success Rate: 100% (4/4 screenshots captured)
```

**Features Tested**:
- Page navigation
- Element interaction
- Form filling
- Screenshot capture
- Error handling

## ⚠️ Issues Found

### Issue 1: "New Project" Button Not Detected

**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Cannot automate full project creation flow
**Test ID**: 1.1-E2E-003

**Details**:
```
Selector used: button:has-text("New Project")
Error: Element not visible or timeout
Possible causes:
  - Button text may be different (e.g., "Create Project", "+ New")
  - Button rendered conditionally
  - Different selector needed (data-testid, aria-label, etc.)
```

**Recommended Fix**:
1. Inspect actual button in browser dev tools
2. Add `data-testid="new-project-button"` to button component
3. Update selector to: `[data-testid="new-project-button"]`

**Workaround**:
Manual testing for project creation until selector is fixed

## 📊 Comparison: Manual vs Automated Testing

| Aspect | Manual Testing | Automated Testing |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Time to capture 4 screenshots** | ~10 minutes | ~15 seconds |
| **Consistency** | Variable (human error) | 100% consistent |
| **Repeatability** | Manual effort each time | One command |
| **Screenshot quality** | Varies | Consistent 1920x1080 |
| **Test verification** | Visual only | Automated assertions |
| **Regression testing** | Time-consuming | Instant |

**Recommendation**: Use automated testing for regression, manual for exploratory

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. ✅ **Playwright is Excellent**: Easy to use, reliable, fast
2. ✅ **ES Modules**: Modern JavaScript works great
3. ✅ **Headless: false**: Seeing browser helps debugging
4. ✅ **slowMo**: Makes actions visible for verification
5. ✅ **Test User Setup**: Pre-existing test user saved time

### What Needs Improvement
1. ⚠️ **Selector Strategy**: Need data-testid attributes
2. ⚠️ **Wait Strategies**: More explicit waits needed
3. ⚠️ **Error Handling**: Could be more robust
4. ⚠️ **Test Assertions**: Need more verification beyond screenshots

### Recommendations
1. 📋 Add `data-testid` attributes to all interactive elements
2. 📋 Use Playwright's auto-wait features more
3. 📋 Add visual regression testing (Percy, Chromatic)
4. 📋 Create page object models for maintainability
