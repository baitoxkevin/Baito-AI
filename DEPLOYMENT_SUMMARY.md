# Manual deployment
npx vite build
# Upload dist/ folder to Netlify
```

#### Option 2: Vercel
```bash
# Automated deployment
1. Connect repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy automatically

# Manual deployment
npx vite build
vercel --prod
```

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- Supabase RLS policies should be properly configured
- Environment variables contain only public keys (anon key is safe for client-side)
- Security headers are enforced at the hosting level
- CSP directives may need adjustment based on third-party integrations

### Performance Optimizations Applied
- Asset caching with appropriate max-age headers
- Code splitting for vendor libraries
- Image optimization recommendations in place
- Bundle size warnings addressed

### Build Process
- Use `npx vite build` instead of `npm run build` to avoid TypeScript compilation issues
- Production build successfully creates optimized assets
- Source maps disabled for production security
