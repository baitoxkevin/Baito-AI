### ⚠️ Project Editing - INCOMPLETE

- Unable to locate edit functionality in the UI

## Bugs Found

### 1. Permission Errors (Critical)
- **Error**: `permission denied for table projects` 
- **Impact**: 401 errors when fetching projects
- **Console Error**: `[ERROR] Error fetching projects: {code: 42501, details: null, hint: null, message: permission denied for table projects}`
- **Frequency**: Occurs on page load and refresh

### 2. Missing Dialog Titles (Accessibility)
- **Error**: `DialogContent requires a DialogTitle for screen reader users`
- **Impact**: Accessibility issue for screen readers
- **Recommendation**: Add DialogTitle components or use VisuallyHidden wrapper

### 3. Missing Edit Functionality
- **Issue**: No apparent way to edit existing projects
- **Expected**: Edit button or action menu on project cards
- **Actual**: Only view details available, no edit options

### 4. UI/UX Issues
- **Date Picker**: End date picker in Schedule step was unresponsive
- **Navigation**: Going back from project details returns to dashboard instead of projects list

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Permission Issues**: Review Supabase RLS policies for projects table
2. **Add Edit Functionality**: Implement edit buttons/menus on project cards
3. **Improve Accessibility**: Add proper DialogTitle components
4. **Fix Navigation Flow**: Ensure back navigation stays within projects section
5. **Test Date Pickers**: Verify date selection works properly in Schedule step

## Conclusion
Project creation functionality works well with a smooth multi-step wizard flow. However, critical issues with permissions and missing edit functionality need to be addressed for full CRUD operations.
