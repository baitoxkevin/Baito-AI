### Option 2: Vercel Deployment

#### Manual Deployment
1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy:**

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - In project settings, add environment variables
   - Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

4. **Deploy:**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy on every push

### Option 3: Static Hosting (AWS S3, CloudFlare Pages, etc.)

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npx vite build
   ```

2. **Upload dist/ folder contents to your hosting platform**

3. **Configure routing:**
   - Set up SPA routing to redirect all routes to `index.html`
   - Configure security headers (see `netlify.toml` for reference)

## Environment Variables Configuration

### Production Environment Variables

Create these environment variables in your hosting platform:

```bash
# Required - Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Optional - Additional Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Security Notes
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use your hosting platform's environment variable management
- Supabase anon key is safe to expose (it's designed for client-side use)
- Ensure Supabase RLS policies are properly configured

## DNS and SSL Setup

### Custom Domain Configuration

#### Netlify
1. Go to Site settings → Domain management
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter your domain name
4. Update DNS records at your domain provider:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www (or @)
   Value: your-site.netlify.app
   ```
5. SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned

#### Vercel
1. Go to Project settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 76.76.19.61

   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```
4. SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned

## Rollback Procedures

### Netlify
1. Go to Site overview → Deploys
2. Find the last working deployment
3. Click "Publish deploy" to rollback

### Vercel
1. Go to Project → Deployments
2. Find the last working deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"

### Emergency Rollback
If you need to quickly revert:
1. Revert the problematic commit in Git
2. Push to main branch
3. Automated deployment will deploy the reverted version

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
1. **TypeScript errors:** Use `npx vite build` instead of `npm run build`
2. **Node version:** Ensure Node.js 18+ is being used
3. **Dependencies:** Run `npm ci` for clean installation

### Runtime Errors
1. **Supabase connection:** Verify environment variables
2. **CORS issues:** Check Supabase project settings
3. **404 errors:** Ensure SPA routing is configured

### Performance Issues
1. **Large bundle size:** Implement code splitting
2. **Slow loading:** Optimize images and enable compression
3. **Cache issues:** Clear CDN cache or update cache headers

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Monthly dependency updates (`npm update`)
- Quarterly security audits (`npm audit`)
- Monitor and optimize bundle sizes
- Review and update security headers

### Update Procedures
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and test locally
3. Create pull request
4. Automated testing runs
5. Deploy to preview environment
6. Merge to main for production deployment
