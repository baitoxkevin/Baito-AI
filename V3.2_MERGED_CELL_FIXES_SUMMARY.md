# V3.2 Merged Cell & Continuation Row Fixes - Summary

**Created:** 2025-10-08
**Version:** 3.2 (Bug Fixes for Merged Cells)
**Purpose:** Fix critical issues with merged cell aggregation and continuation row detection

---

## üêõ **Issues Discovered**

### Issue #1: Duplicate Candidates from Merged Cells
**Problem:** Chan Chiu Ling appeared TWICE in extracted data instead of once

**Root Cause:** The unique key included row index:
```python
key = f"{ic_number}_{sheet_name}_{idx}"  # ‚Üê Wrong!
```

This created a new candidate entry for EVERY row, even continuation rows.

**Example:**
- Row 1: Chan Chiu Ling (IC: 980104145412) - Days=3, Payment=120
- Row 2: (continuation, merged cells) - Days=1, Payment=140
- Row 3: (continuation, merged cells) - Days=1, Payment=150

**Result Before Fix:**
- Record 1: Days=0, Payment=3 (incorrect values)
- Record 2: Days=5, Payment=150 (only partial data)

**Fix:** Remove row index from key:
```python
key = f"{ic_number}_{sheet_name}"  # ‚Üê Correct!
```

**Result After Fix:**
- Record 1: Days=5 (3+1+1), Payment=650 ‚úì

---

### Issue #2: Section Boundary Overlap
**Problem:** Candidates were processed multiple times when sheets had multiple table sections

**Root Cause:** When reading sections, script read 200 rows from each header:
```python
section_df = pd.read_excel(excel_path, sheet_name=sheet_name,
                           skiprows=header_row_idx, nrows=200)
```

For a sheet with 2 headers at rows 3 and 7:
- Section 1: Read rows 3-203 (includes ALL candidates)
- Section 2: Read rows 7-207 (includes candidates from row 7 onward)
- Result: Candidates from row 7+ were processed TWICE

**Fix:** Only read until next header row:
```python
if idx_pos < len(header_rows) - 1:
    nrows = header_rows[idx_pos + 1] - header_row_idx - 1
else:
    nrows = 200  # Last section
```

**Result:** Each candidate processed exactly once ‚úì

---

### Issue #3: Roster Sections Contaminating Payment Data
**Problem:** Chan Jee Fei showed Wages=1937 instead of 190

**Analysis:**
- Row 3: Chan Jee Fei (with IC) - Days=11, Wages=120, Payment=1747
- Row 4: (continuation, no IC) - Days=1, Wages=70
- Row 13: "Chan Jee Fei" (name only, NO IC) - Part of roster schedule, not payment data

**Root Cause:** Script aggregated ANY row with empty Name/IC as continuation:
```python
if current_candidate and current_candidate in candidates:
    # Aggregated row 13's data even though it was roster, not payment!
```

**Fix:** Only aggregate rows with BOTH Name AND IC empty (true continuation rows):
```python
has_name_no_ic = (
    pd.notna(row.get(name_cols[0])) and
    pd.isna(row.get(ic_cols[0]))
)

if current_candidate and not has_name_no_ic:
    # Aggregate data
```

**Result:** Roster sections skipped ‚úì

---

### Issue #4: First Row Data Not Aggregated
**Problem:** After fixing Issue #3, Chan Jee Fei showed Days=1, Wages=70 (only continuation row data)

**Root Cause:** When creating a new candidate, we didn't aggregate the first row's data:
```python
if pd.notna(name) and pd.notna(ic):
    # Create candidate
    candidates[key] = {..., 'days_worked': 0, ...}

# Only aggregate continuation rows (name/IC empty)
is_continuation = pd.isna(name) and pd.isna(ic)
if current_candidate and is_continuation:
    # Aggregate
```

**Fix:** Aggregate BOTH first row AND continuation rows:
```python
# Aggregate for current candidate UNLESS it's a roster row (name but no IC)
has_name_no_ic = (pd.notna(name) and pd.isna(ic))

if current_candidate and not has_name_no_ic:
    # Aggregate data from this row
```

**Result:** First row + continuation rows all aggregated correctly ‚úì

---

### Issue #5: "Payment" Column Ambiguity
**Problem:**
- Chan Chiu Ling (Blackmores): Wages=0 (expected 410)
- Different sheets use "Payment" column differently:
  - **Blackmores:** "Payment" = per-row wages (120, 140, 150) + "Total" = final total (650)
  - **HSBC:** "Payment" = final total (1747), no "Total" column

**Root Cause:** Script treated "Payment" as final total in ALL cases

**Fix:** Intelligent detection:
```python
if payment_cols and pd.notna(row.get(payment_cols[0])):
    val = safe_float(row[payment_cols[0]])
    if total_cols:
        # Has both Payment AND Total ‚Üí Payment is per-row wages
        candidates[current_candidate]['total_wages'] += val
    else:
        # Only Payment ‚Üí Payment is final total
        if val > candidates[current_candidate]['total_payment']:
            candidates[current_candidate]['total_payment'] = val
```

**Result:**
- Blackmores: Payment (120+140+150=410) ‚Üí total_wages ‚úì
- HSBC: Payment (1747) ‚Üí total_payment ‚úì

---

## ‚úÖ **All Fixes Verified**

### Test Case 1: Chan Chiu Ling (Blackmores)
**Sheet Structure:**
- Multiple table sections (Sticker + Main)
- Merged cells with 3 continuation rows
- Has BOTH "Payment" and "Total" columns

**Expected:**
- Days: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5
- Wages: 120 + 140 + 150 = 410 (from Payment column)
- Total: 650 (from Total column)

**Result:** ‚úÖ ALL CORRECT
- Days: 5.0 ‚úì
- Wages: 410.0 ‚úì
- Payment: 650.0 ‚úì

---

### Test Case 2: Chan Jee Fei (HSBC)
**Sheet Structure:**
- Single table section
- 1 continuation row
- Roster section below (name without IC)
- Has ONLY "Payment" column, no "Total"

**Expected:**
- Days: 11 + 1 = 12
- Wages: 120 + 70 = 190
- Allowance: 20 + 20 = 40
- Claim: 117 + 0 = 117
- Payment: 1747 (from Payment column)

**Result:** ‚úÖ ALL CORRECT
- Days: 12.0 ‚úì
- Wages: 190.0 ‚úì
- Allowance: 40.0 ‚úì
- Claim: 117.0 ‚úì
- Payment: 1747.0 ‚úì

## üîß **Technical Details**

### Key Algorithm Changes

#### 1. Candidate Key Generation
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong):
key = f"{ic_number}_{sheet_name}_{idx}"  # Unique per row

# AFTER (Correct):
key = f"{ic_number}_{sheet_name}"  # Unique per candidate per sheet
```

#### 2. Section Boundary Detection
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong):
nrows = 200  # Always read 200 rows

# AFTER (Correct):
if idx_pos < len(header_rows) - 1:
    nrows = header_rows[idx_pos + 1] - header_row_idx - 1
else:
    nrows = 200
```

#### 3. Continuation Row Detection
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong):
if current_candidate:
    # Aggregated ALL rows including roster sections

# AFTER (Correct):
has_name_no_ic = (pd.notna(name) and pd.isna(ic))
if current_candidate and not has_name_no_ic:
    # Only aggregate payment rows, skip roster
```

#### 4. Payment Column Handling
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong):
if payment_cols:
    total_payment = max(val, total_payment)  # Always final total

# AFTER (Correct):
if payment_cols and pd.notna(val):
    if total_cols:
        total_wages += val  # Payment is wages (has separate Total)
    else:
        total_payment = max(val, total_payment)  # Payment is total
```

## üí° **Key Learnings**

### 1. Merged Cells Are Tricky
- Excel merged cells only show data in first cell
- Continuation rows have empty Name/IC columns
- Must use "current candidate" tracking to aggregate

### 2. Column Names Are Inconsistent
- Same concept has different names across sheets
- "Payment" can mean wages OR final total
- Must detect context to handle correctly

### 3. Multi-Section Sheets Need Careful Handling
- Can't blindly read 200 rows
- Must find section boundaries
- Prevent data overlap

### 4. Roster vs Payment Sections
- Roster sections have Name but no IC/bank data
- Must distinguish from payment continuation rows
- Skip roster to avoid contamination
