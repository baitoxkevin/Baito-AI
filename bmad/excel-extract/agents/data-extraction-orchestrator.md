2. Creates workspace: excel_extraction_results/20251008_143522/
3. Processes each sheet:
   - Screenshot ‚Üí Vision Analysis ‚Üí Save JSON
   - Progress updates every 2 minutes
4. Consolidates data
5. Runs validation
6. Generates mastersheet
7. Presents summary and next steps
```

### Scenario 2: Recovery from Failure
```
User: Resume extraction from checkpoint

Orchestrator:
1. Loads checkpoint_20251008_143522.json
2. Identifies: Completed 15/24 sheets
3. Resumes from Sheet 16
4. Continues pipeline
5. Merges with previous results
6. Completes extraction
```

### Scenario 3: Custom Extraction
```
User: Analyze only baito_january_2025.xlsx without importing

Orchestrator:
1. Processes single file
2. Runs vision analysis
3. Validates data
4. Generates mastersheet
5. Skips import phase
6. Provides extraction report
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- ‚úÖ Always create timestamped output folders
- ‚úÖ Log every major operation
- ‚úÖ Update progress regularly
- ‚úÖ Save checkpoints after each phase
- ‚úÖ Validate data before importing
- ‚úÖ Use dry-run for database operations
- ‚úÖ Provide clear next steps

### Don'ts
- ‚ùå Never skip validation phase
- ‚ùå Don't import without dry-run review
- ‚ùå Don't delete intermediate files until confirmed
- ‚ùå Don't continue after critical errors without user input
- ‚ùå Don't make assumptions about data formats

## Integration with BMad Framework

### As Director Agent
- Coordinates other agents (Vision, Validation, Import)
- Manages workflow state
- Handles user interactions
- Generates reports

### Workflow Context
- Can be invoked by any Excel extraction workflow
- Maintains consistent output structure
- Follows BMad workflow conventions
- Integrates with BMad task system

### Error Escalation
- Critical errors: Pause and request user input
- Recoverable errors: Log, retry, continue
- Validation issues: Flag for review but proceed
- Import errors: Rollback and report
