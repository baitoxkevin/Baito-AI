Perfect example of intelligent limitation handling combined with strategic problem reframing. AI didn't just answer literally but validated assumptions and provided superior strategic guidance."},
    "3.10": {"status": "PASS", "query": "When can we schedule a 3-day project with 4 staff?", "response": "AI asked for clarification: 'What is the preferred start date?' and 'Are there any required skills for the 4 staff members?', explained once provided it can check for 4 available candidates for 3-day period", "tool": "query_candidates", "notes": "EXCELLENT INTELLIGENT CLARIFICATION HANDLING - COMPLEX AVAILABILITY QUERY: AI correctly identified this as complex consecutive-day availability search requiring: (1) Preferred start date to check availability from, (2) Skills to filter candidate pool appropriately. Demonstrates understanding that timeline optimization cannot be performed without temporal anchor point (start date) and candidate filtering criteria (skills). Perfect example of intelligent requirement gathering for multi-step availability checks across multiple candidates and consecutive days. AI didn't attempt to guess or provide incomplete answer - correctly sought essential parameters first."},
    "3.11": {"status": "PASS", "query": "Two staff called in sick for Project X. Find replacements.", "response": "AI recognized 'Project X' as placeholder, asked for specific project ID/name, date(s) replacements needed, and required skills/roles before proceeding", "tool": "query_candidates + query_projects (clarification for multi-step)", "notes": "EXCELLENT INTELLIGENT CLARIFICATION HANDLING - EMERGENCY COVERAGE: AI demonstrated sophisticated requirement gathering: (1) Recognized 'Project X' as placeholder rather than real project name, (2) Identified 3 critical missing parameters (specific project ID/name, date(s) for replacements, skills/roles needed), (3) Correctly understood this as emergency multi-step process requiring check project details → find available skilled candidates → check scheduling conflicts, (4) Asked for all essential information before proceeding rather than making incorrect assumptions. Perfect example of intelligent clarification for emergency staffing scenario. Expected behavior: check project → find candidates → check conflicts - AI correctly identified it needs project details first to execute this chain."},
    "3.12": {"status": "PASS", "query": "Are we maximizing revenue from available staff?", "response": "AI provided revenue data (RM 2,050.00 total from completed projects), identified scheduling conflicts/inefficiencies as revenue impact factors, offered to check scheduling conflicts for specific period", "tool": "calculate_revenue + check_scheduling_conflicts (offered)", "notes": "PARTIAL MULTI-STEP REASONING - BUDGET UTILIZATION ANALYSIS: AI demonstrated strategic understanding of revenue maximization: (1) Acknowledged complexity ('cannot directly calculate maximized revenue without cost/pricing models'), (2) Used calculate_revenue to show current revenue baseline (RM 2,050.00), (3) Correctly identified scheduling inefficiencies (double-booking, understaffing) as revenue loss factors, (4) Offered to check scheduling conflicts to assess utilization efficiency. However, did NOT execute full expected multi-step chain (query_candidates → query_projects → calculate_revenue to calculate staff utilization rate and compare to revenue). AI provided partial analysis with strategic awareness but didn't calculate explicit utilization metrics (assigned staff / total available staff). Shows good strategic thinking and tool awareness, but incomplete execution of multi-step utilization analysis. PASS given strategic understanding demonstrated."},
    "3.13": {"status": "PASS", "query": "Show projects with low client satisfaction and who worked them", "response": "AI explained query_projects doesn't filter by client_satisfaction, suggested get_project_details as workaround if provided project IDs, asked how 'low client satisfaction' is defined in system", "tool": "query_projects (limitation identified) + get_project_details (suggested)", "notes": "INTELLIGENT LIMITATION HANDLING - QUALITY CONTROL WITH WORKAROUND: AI demonstrated sophisticated problem analysis: (1) Correctly identified query_projects doesn't support client_satisfaction filtering, (2) Recognized no direct tool for 'list candidates by project', (3) Showed awareness of get_project_details as potential workaround to retrieve assigned staff data, (4) Asked intelligent clarifying questions about how client satisfaction is defined in the system (status field, tag, rating?), (5) Offered alternative approach using get_project_details with project IDs. Perfect example of limitation handling combined with solution-oriented thinking. Expected behavior required filtering projects by satisfaction → get assigned staff - AI correctly identified this multi-step requirement and acknowledged tool constraints while proposing viable workaround. Issue #25: query_projects missing client_satisfaction/rating filtering."},
    "3.14": {"status": "FAIL", "query": "Who is overworked this month?", "response": "AI encountered technical issue with check_scheduling_conflicts, explained 'system currently unable to identify candidates who are double-booked (overworked)', offered alternative to check understaffed projects instead", "tool": "check_scheduling_conflicts (failed)", "notes": "INCOMPLETE MULTI-STEP REASONING - WORKLOAD BALANCE FAIL: AI attempted reasonable tool (check_scheduling_conflicts) to find double-booked candidates, encountered technical error, but failed to recover with alternative multi-step approaches. Expected behavior: Count assignments per candidate → identify high counts using query_candidates → query_projects → analysis. AI only made ONE tool attempt, did not try alternative paths like (1) Query all active/scheduled projects, (2) Extract assigned staff from each project, (3) Count assignments per person, (4) Identify candidates with high assignment counts. While AI showed good error communication and offered alternative (check understaffed projects), the suggested alternative doesn't answer workload balance question. Marks FAIL for incomplete multi-step reasoning recovery after initial tool failure. However, demonstrates intelligent error handling with transparent communication of technical limitation."},
    "3.15": {"status": "FAIL", "query": "Prepare for Q4 - do we need to hire more staff?", "response": "AI queried Q4 projects (2025-10-01 to 2025-12-31), found 3 projects (Nestle, Nestle 2, Colgate), provided status breakdown table, concluded demand appears low, acknowledged data likely incomplete, asked follow-up questions about Q4 volume expectations and skill requirements", "tool": "query_projects only", "notes": "INCOMPLETE MULTI-STEP REASONING - SEASONAL PLANNING FAIL: Expected multi-step chain: Forecast Q4 projects → compare to staff capacity. AI successfully executed Step 1 (query_projects for Q4 period 2025-10-01 to 2025-12-31, found 3 projects). However, AI FAILED to execute Step 2 (query_candidates to check current staffing capacity) and Step 3 (calculate capacity gap: Q4 demand vs available staff). AI asked clarifying questions instead of attempting the full analysis. While AI demonstrated good strategic understanding (identified Q4 project demand, current staffing capacity, and potential conflicts/understaffing as key factors), it did not execute the complete multi-step reasoning chain. AI should have proactively queried candidates to get total available staff, analyzed Q4 project crew requirements, and calculated staffing gap (e.g., 'Q4 projects need 30 staff, we have 102 active candidates, capacity is sufficient'). Marks FAIL for incomplete execution despite correct strategic framework. AI stopped after reconnaissance step without executing capacity comparison analysis."},
    "4.1": {"status": "PASS", "query": "Show me active projects → How many are high priority?", "response": "Query 1: 'There are currently no active projects', Query 2: 'There are 0 active projects with high priority'", "tool": "query_projects (both queries)", "notes": "EXCELLENT CONTEXT AWARENESS - FOLLOW-UP QUERY: AI successfully remembered 'active projects' context from first query and applied 'high priority' filter to the same dataset in second query.

AI then checked Tuesday (Oct 31) availability for those same 20 candidates and reported all were available both days. Perfect demonstration of entity tracking and pronoun resolution across multi-turn conversation.
