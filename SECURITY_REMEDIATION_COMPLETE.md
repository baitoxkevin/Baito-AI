# ✅ Security Remediation Complete

## Actions Taken

### 1. Git History Cleaned ✅
- Used BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove all exposed secrets from git history
- 67 object IDs were changed across 37 commits
- Exposed secrets have been completely purged from repository history

### 2. Files Secured ✅
- Removed `.mcp.json` and `mcp.json` from git tracking
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude these files permanently
- Created `.mcp.json.example` template without sensitive data

### 3. Backup Created ✅
- Full repository backup saved as `backup-project-10-*.tar.gz`

### 4. Environment Variables Setup ✅
- Created `.env.secure.example` template
- Created `setup-secure-env.sh` script for secure configuration
- Set up proper environment variable handling

### 5. Pre-commit Hooks Installed ✅
- Installed Husky for git hooks management
- Configured secret detection pre-commit hook
- Will automatically block commits containing:
  - Supabase access tokens
  - API keys
  - Passwords
  - `.mcp.json` or `mcp.json` files

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Next Steps Required

### 1. Rotate ALL Compromised Keys (URGENT)

The following keys were exposed and MUST be rotated immediately:

#### Supabase Access Token
- **Exposed Token**: `sbp_8a5d6de3b1c2d8c989be89d41829543c168d9e2c`
- **Action**: 
  1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
  2. Revoke this token immediately
  3. Generate a new access token
  4. Update your local `.env.secure` file

#### 21st.dev API Key
- **Exposed Key**: `617d2248835f7742fb97cb1c0e417aeed44ad4a33d871e8e65540879b876b5e2`
- **Action**:
  1. Visit your 21st.dev account settings
  2. Regenerate your API key
  3. Update your local `.env.secure` file

#### Google API Key
- **Exposed Key**: `AIzaSyAUzT3o4vg-Htn-l_rd_JiujplI48Mjf4Q`
- **Action**:
  1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
  2. Delete or restrict this key immediately
  3. Create a new key with proper restrictions
  4. Update your local `.env.secure` file

### 2. Set Up New Secure Configuration

1. Copy the secure environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.secure.example .env.secure
   ```

2. Edit `.env.secure` and add your NEW API keys:
   ```bash
   nano .env.secure  # or use your preferred editor
   ```

3. Generate MCP config from environment variables:
   ```bash
   ./setup-secure-env.sh
   ```

### 3. Force Push Clean History (if repository is private)

If this is a private repository and you want to completely clean the remote:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
git push --force-with-lease origin feat/candidate-dashboard
```

⚠️ **WARNING**: Force pushing will rewrite history for all collaborators. They will need to re-clone or reset their local repositories.

### 4. If Repository is Public

If this repository has ever been public or shared:
- The exposed keys should be considered permanently compromised
- Rotate them immediately regardless of git history cleaning
- Monitor for any unauthorized usage
- Consider the keys as public knowledge

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Rotated Supabase access token
- [ ] Rotated 21st.dev API key
- [ ] Rotated Google API key
- [ ] Updated `.env.secure` with new keys
- [ ] Generated new `.mcp.json` from secure environment
- [ ] Force pushed clean history (if appropriate)
- [ ] Notified team members about repository changes
- [ ] Monitored API usage for suspicious activity

## Prevention Measures Now in Place

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatically scan for secrets before commits
2. **Gitignore Protection**: `.mcp.json` and `mcp.json` are permanently excluded
3. **Environment Variables**: Secrets stored in `.env.secure` (never committed)
4. **Template Files**: Safe `.example` files for configuration reference

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Enable GitHub Secret Scanning**: If using GitHub, enable secret scanning in repository settings
2. **Use Secret Management**: Consider using:
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - GitHub Secrets (for CI/CD)
3. **Regular Audits**: Run periodic security scans:
   ```bash
   npx gitleaks detect --source . --verbose
   ```

**Remember**: The keys are still compromised until you rotate them. Complete the rotation immediately!
