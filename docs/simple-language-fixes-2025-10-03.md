# Simple Language Testing Fixes - October 3, 2025

## Bugs Discovered Through Simple Language Testing

User requested: "loop the test with -> test -> fix -> suggestion -> think -> fix use 10 years old thinking to ask the chatbot"

This approach revealed **4 critical bugs** that formal testing missed!

---

## Bug #1: "Who has a car?" - Missing has_vehicle Filter ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

### Discovery
**Query:** "Who has a car?" (simple, casual language)
**AI Response:** "I do not have a specific filter for 'has a car'..."
**Issue:** The `has_vehicle` parameter was missing from the AI function definition

### Root Cause
The `query_candidates` function was missing the `has_vehicle` boolean parameter in its schema, even though the database filtering logic was already implemented.

### Fix Applied
**File:** `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts`
**Lines:** 210-213

**Added parameter:**
```typescript
has_vehicle: {
  type: 'boolean',
  description: 'Filter candidates who have their own vehicle/car'
}
```

### How to Test
1. Open chat widget
2. Ask: **"Who has a car?"**
3. Expected: AI searches using `has_vehicle: true` filter and returns candidates with vehicles
4. ‚úÖ PASS if AI shows candidates who have cars
5. ‚ùå FAIL if AI asks for clarification or can't search

## Bug #2: "What's happening this month?" - Wrong Date Logic ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

### Discovery
**Query:** "What's happening this month?"
**AI Response:** "There are no projects scheduled to start in October 2025."
**User Feedback:** "there's event happening" (indicating AI missed ongoing projects)

### Root Cause
The AI was using `date_from` and `date_to` parameters which only check if projects START in the date range, not if projects are ACTIVE/ONGOING during the range.

**Example:**
- MrDIY Project: Sept 30 - Oct 4
- Query: "What's happening in October?"
- Old behavior: ‚ùå Returns 0 results (project started in September)
- Expected: ‚úÖ Should return the project (it's active in October)

### Fix Applied
**File:** `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts`

**Changes:**

1. **Updated parameter descriptions (Lines 160-169):**
```typescript
date_from: {
  description: 'finds projects with START DATE on or after this date. NOTE: Use this for "projects starting in October", NOT for "what\'s happening in October"'
}
date_to: {
  description: 'finds projects with START DATE on or before this date. NOTE: Use this for "projects starting in October", NOT for "what\'s happening in October"'
}
```

2. **Enhanced system prompt (Lines 442-448):**
```typescript
IMPORTANT: When users ask "What's happening this month?" or "events this month":
- They usually want to know about TODAY's activity or current activity
- Use 'active_on_date' with today's date to show what's currently active
- If they specifically ask for "all month", use 'date_from' and 'date_to' but explain it shows projects STARTING in that range
- Example responses:
  - "What's happening this month?" ‚Üí Show active_on_date for TODAY + mention "These are today's active projects"
  - "What's starting this month?" ‚Üí Use date_from/date_to for the month range
```

### How to Test
1. Open chat widget
2. Ask: **"What's happening this month?"**
3. Expected: AI uses `active_on_date` with today's date and shows currently active projects
4. AI should mention "These are today's active projects" or similar
5. ‚úÖ PASS if AI shows MrDIY project (Sept 30 - Oct 4) when asked on Oct 3
6. ‚ùå FAIL if AI says "no projects in October"

## Bug #3: "Show me people with forklift skills" - Missing Skills Filter ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

### Discovery
**Proactive Check:** Reviewing test scenarios 1.10-1.15
**Test Query:** "Show me candidates with forklift certification"
**Issue:** Skills parameter defined but NOT IMPLEMENTED in query logic

### Root Cause
The `skills` parameter existed in the function schema but the actual filtering code was missing in `queryCandidates`. The database has a `skills` TEXT[] column, but the query never used it.

### Fix Applied
**File:** `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts`

**Changes:**

1. **Added skills to SELECT (Line 688):**
```typescript
.select('id, full_name, ..., skills, custom_fields')
```

2. **Implemented skills filtering (Lines 706-711):**
```typescript
if (args.skills && args.skills.length > 0) {
  console.log('[queryCandidates] Filtering by skills:', args.skills)
  // Use 'overlaps' to check if candidate's skills array has ANY of the requested skills
  query = query.overlaps('skills', args.skills)
}
```

### How to Test
1. Open chat widget
2. Ask: **"Show me people with forklift skills"**
3. Expected: AI searches using `skills: ["forklift"]` and returns matching candidates
4. ‚úÖ PASS if AI shows candidates who have forklift in their skills array

## Bug #4: "Which projects need more staff?" - Missing Understaffed Filter ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ

### Discovery
**Proactive Check:** Reviewing test scenarios 1.10-1.15
**Test Query:** "Which projects need more staff?"
**Issue:** No direct way to query understaffed projects (filled_positions < crew_count)

### Root Cause
While `check_scheduling_conflicts` could find understaffed projects, there was no direct parameter in `query_projects` to filter them. Users asking "which projects need more staff?" would get a complex conflict report instead of a simple project list.

### Fix Applied
**File:** `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts`

**Changes:**

1. **Added understaffed parameter (Lines 174-177):**
```typescript
understaffed: {
  type: 'boolean',
  description: 'Filter projects that need more staff (filled_positions < crew_count). Use this for queries like "which projects need more staff?" or "understaffed projects"'
}
```

2. **Implemented post-query filtering (Lines 644-653):**
```typescript
// Apply post-query filters
let filteredData = data

// Filter understaffed projects if requested
if (args.understaffed === true) {
  filteredData = filteredData.filter((p: any) => p.filled_positions < p.crew_count)
}

// Apply limit after post-filtering
filteredData = filteredData.slice(0, args.limit || 10)
```

### How to Test
1. Open chat widget
2. Ask: **"Which projects need more staff?"**
3. Expected: AI uses `understaffed: true` parameter
4. Result: Shows only projects where filled_positions < crew_count
5. ‚úÖ PASS if AI shows understaffed projects with clear counts

## Lessons Learned

### Why Simple Language Testing Works Better

**Formal Testing:**
- ‚úÖ Tests exact parameters: `has_vehicle: true`
- ‚ùå Misses natural language: "Who has a car?"

**Simple Language Testing (10-Year-Old Style):**
- ‚úÖ Tests how users actually talk
- ‚úÖ Reveals missing features AI can't understand
- ‚úÖ Finds edge cases formal tests miss

**Example:**
- Formal test: `query_candidates({has_vehicle: true})` ‚Üí ‚úÖ PASS (database query works)
- Simple test: "Who has a car?" ‚Üí ‚ùå FAIL (AI doesn't know how to search)
- **Result:** Database works, but AI can't use it!
