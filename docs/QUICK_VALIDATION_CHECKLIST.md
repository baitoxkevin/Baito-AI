## ❌ If Any Test Fails:

1. Note which test failed

## 📱 What You Should Experience:

### Perfect Flow:
```
Login → Instant dashboard → Data appears → Refresh → Instant dashboard → Data appears → Repeat forever
```

### Avatar Behavior:
```
Refresh → "U" for 1-2 seconds → "KR" appears → Data loads
```

This brief "U" → "KR" transition is NORMAL and EXPECTED. It means auth is loading in background without blocking UI.
