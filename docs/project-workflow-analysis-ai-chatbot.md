**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-09
**Project Scope:** AI Chatbot Feature Expansion (Phase 2-3)
**Field Type:** Brownfield Enhancement
**Parent Project:** Baito-AI Workforce Management Platform

---

## Project Classification

### Project Level: **1** (Small/Moderate Feature Enhancement)

**Rationale:**
- Expanding existing AI chatbot from 6 ‚Üí 50+ tools
- Infrastructure already exists (Supabase Edge Functions, OpenRouter, database tables with RLS)
- Well-defined requirements in AI_CHATBOT_PRD.md
- Clear implementation path defined in Sprint Change Proposal
- Moderate complexity: 44 new tools across 6 sprints (9-13 weeks)

### Field Type: **Brownfield**

- Existing AI chatbot infrastructure (ReAct loop implemented)
- 50+ database tables with RLS policies already in place
- Current implementation: 6 tools (12% coverage)
- Target: 50 tools (100% coverage)

### Project Type: **Backend Service Enhancement**

- **Primary:** Backend Edge Function expansion (Supabase Functions)
- **Secondary:** Frontend chat UI (already exists, minor enhancements)
- **Technology:** TypeScript + Deno (Edge Functions) + OpenRouter API

## User Interface Analysis

### Has User Interface: **true**

**UI Complexity:** Simple (already built)

**Existing UI Components:**
- Chat widget (src/components/ai-assistant/ChatWidget.tsx)
- Message list (src/components/ai-assistant/MessageList.tsx)
- Quick actions (src/components/ai-assistant/QuickActions.tsx)
- Typing indicator (src/components/ai-assistant/TypingIndicator.tsx)

**UI Changes Required:**
- Minimal: Update quick action buttons for new entity types
- Add entity-specific result cards (warehouse items, expense claims, tasks)
- Add photo preview for warehouse items with images
- Enhance error messages for new tool categories

**UX Spec Status:**
- Base UX spec exists: /docs/ux-specification.md
- Course Correction identified need for Section 8: Entity-Specific User Flows
- UX updates are ADDITIVE (new flows for warehouse, expense, tasks, attendance)

## Architecture Analysis

### Existing Architecture: **Well-Defined**

**Architecture Documentation:** /docs/architecture.md (847 lines)

**Current AI Chatbot Architecture:**
- Edge Function: supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts
- LLM Provider: OpenRouter with Gemini 2.5 Flash ($0.20/1M tokens)
- Pattern: ReAct loop (Reasoning + Acting)
- Database: Direct Supabase queries with RLS enforcement
- Conversation History: pgvector semantic search (future)

**Infrastructure Status:**
- ‚úÖ 50+ database tables with complete RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Supabase Edge Functions configured
- ‚úÖ OpenRouter integration working
- ‚úÖ Authentication flow integrated
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting and security in place
- ‚è≥ Tool-to-table mappings need documentation

### Architecture Style: **Serverless Edge Functions + BaaS**

- Serverless: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security
- Frontend: React SPA
- State Management: React Query (for chat state)

### Repository Strategy: **Monorepo**

- Single repository: Baito-AI
- Frontend + Edge Functions + Database migrations in one repo
- Deployment: Netlify (frontend) + Supabase Cloud (backend)
