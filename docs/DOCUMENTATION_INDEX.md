## Overview

This documentation suite was created to support the development of a **new standalone Gigworker Platform** - a mobile-first PWA for gigworkers to find gigs, manage work, track time and salary, with Vimigo-inspired gamification.

### Project Context

- **Existing System:** Baito-AI (workforce management platform for event staffing companies)
- **New Platform:** Standalone Gigworker Interface (consumer-facing, mobile-first)
- **Technology Alignment:** Both systems use React + TypeScript + Supabase
- **Research Focus:** Gamification strategies from Vimigo and industry best practices

### Documentation Deliverables

âœ… **4 comprehensive architecture documents** covering:
1. Brownfield architecture (existing Baito-AI system)
2. Full-stack architecture (new Gigworker Platform)
3. Frontend architecture (new Gigworker Platform)
4. Backend architecture (new Gigworker Platform)

### Integration Considerations

**Baito-AI Integration Options:**

1. **Shared Database** (Recommended if data sync needed)
   - Same Supabase project
   - Shared tables: `candidates`, `projects`, `companies`
   - Separate tables: `gigs`, `applications`, `gamification`
   - Benefits: Real-time sync, single source of truth
   - Risks: Schema conflicts, migration complexity

2. **Separate Databases** (Recommended for isolation)
   - Different Supabase projects
   - API integration for data sync
   - Benefits: Independence, clear boundaries
   - Risks: Sync complexity, data consistency

**Recommendation:** Start with **separate databases** for MVP, evaluate integration needs after launch.
