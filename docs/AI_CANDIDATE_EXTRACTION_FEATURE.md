# AI-Powered Candidate Information Extraction

## Overview

We've successfully enhanced the Candidate Import Tool with AI reasoning capabilities! The system now intelligently extracts and maps candidate information from unstructured resume text using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. **Dual Extraction Modes**
   - **Regex Mode** (Default): Fast pattern-based extraction for structured resumes
   - **AI Mode**: Intelligent reasoning for unstructured or complex resume formats

### 2. **AI Reasoning Engine**
   - Analyzes resume text using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via OpenRouter)
   - Provides confidence scores for each extracted field
   - Explains reasoning behind each extraction
   - Identifies missing or ambiguous data
   - Suggests improvements for data quality

### 3. **Smart Field Mapping**
   - Automatically maps data to 20+ candidate fields:
     - Personal info (name, email, phone, IC number)
     - Demographics (age, race, date of birth)
     - Physical attributes (height, tshirt size)
     - Work details (transportation, languages, experience)
     - Emergency contacts
     - Skills and education arrays

### 4. **Confidence Scoring**
   - **High** (Green): AI is very confident about the extraction
   - **Medium** (Yellow): Reasonable confidence but may need review
   - **Low** (Red): Low confidence, manual verification recommended

### 5. **Privacy-First Design**
   - API keys stored locally in browser (localStorage)
   - Never sent to our servers
   - Direct communication with chosen AI provider
   - User has full control over data and API usage

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Configure AI Settings

1. Click the **Settings** button in the Candidate Import Tool
2. Select your AI provider (OpenRouter recommended)
3. Enter your API key

4. Save settings

### Step 2: Enable AI Mode

1. Toggle the **"Enable AI"** switch to activate AI extraction
2. The header will change to show "AI-Powered Candidate Profile Generator"
3. Icon changes from ‚ö° to üß† to indicate AI mode is active

### Step 3: Extract Candidate Information

1. Paste resume text into the input area
2. Click **"Extract Profile"** button

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### AI Not Working
**Symptom**: Toggle doesn't enable or errors occur
**Solutions**:
1. Check API key is entered in settings
2. Verify API key is valid (test at provider's website)
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Ensure you have API credits available
5. Try switching providers in settings

### Low Confidence Scores
**Symptom**: AI shows yellow/red confidence badges
**Solutions**:
1. Review the extracted data carefully
2. Check AI reasoning for explanations
3. Manually correct any incorrect fields
4. Consider providing more structured resume format
5. Use regex mode for known formats

### Slow Performance
**Symptom**: Extraction takes >10 seconds
**Solutions**:
1. Normal for AI mode (API calls take time)
2. Use regex mode for faster results
3. Check your internet connection
4. Verify API provider status
