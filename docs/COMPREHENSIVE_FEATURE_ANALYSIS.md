## üí≥ Malaysia-Specific Payment Strategy

### Legal Requirements (Gig Worker Bill 2025)

**7-Day Payment Rule:**
- Workers MUST be paid within 7 days of service completion
- This is a LEGAL REQUIREMENT, not optional
- Penalties for non-compliance

**Payment Method Requirements:**
- Service agreement must specify payment method
- Must detail rate and earnings calculation
- Must include benefits, tips, gratuity information

### Recommended Payment Options for Malaysia
