# 📋 Project Creator Tracking - Implementation Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Field** ✓
Your database **already has** `created_by` tracking:
```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),  -- ✓ Tracks who created the project
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  ...
);
```

### 2. **Automatic Creator Logging** ✓
Modified `/src/lib/projects.ts` to automatically record who creates each project:

```typescript
// Now captures current user when creating project
const currentUser = await getUser();
const projectData = {
  ...projectToInsert,
  created_by: currentUser?.id || null,  // ✓ Auto-set creator
  created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  ...
};
```

### 3. **Activity Logging** ✓
Added comprehensive activity tracking when projects are created:

```typescript
await activityLogger.log({
  action: 'create_project',
  activity_type: 'data_change',
  project_id: data.id,
  details: {
    project_title: data.title,
    event_type: data.event_type,
    created_by: currentUser?.id,
    creator_name: currentUser?.full_name || currentUser?.email
  }
});
```

### 4. **UI Display** ✓
Updated the Spotlight Card Overview to show creator information:

**Location:** Project Information card in the spotlight view

**Displays:**
- Creation date and time
- Creator's name (from user profile)

Example:
```
Created
2 October 2025, 23:06
by John Doe
```

## 📊 How to View Creator Information

### Method 1: In the UI (Recommended)
1. Open any project
2. View the Spotlight Card
3. Look at "Project Information" section
4. See **"Created"** with date/time and creator name

### Method 2: Via Database Query
```sql
-- Get project with creator info
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.title,
  p.created_at,
  p.created_by,
  u.full_name as creator_name,
  u.email as creator_email
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = p.created_by
WHERE p.title = 'MrDIY Flagship Opening';
```

### Method 3: Activity Logs
```sql
-- Get all activity for a project including creation
SELECT
  activity_type,
  action,
  user_name as performed_by,
  details,
  created_at
FROM activity_logs
WHERE project_id = 'your-project-id'
  AND action = 'create_project'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

## 🔍 Accessing Activity Logs

### Via Browser Console
```javascript
// Get all activity for a specific project
const projectId = 'your-project-id';
const logs = await activityLogger.getProjectLogs(projectId, 100);
console.log('Project activity:', logs);

// Filter for creation events
const creationLog = logs.find(log => log.action === 'create_project');
console.log('Created by:', creationLog?.details?.creator_name);
console.log('Created at:', creationLog?.timestamp);
```

### Via React Component
```typescript
import { activityLogger } from '@/lib/activity-logger';

// In your component
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchLogs = async () => {
    const logs = await activityLogger.getProjectLogs(projectId);
    const creationLog = logs.find(log => log.action === 'create_project');
    console.log('Creator:', creationLog?.details?.creator_name);
  };
  fetchLogs();
}, [projectId]);
```

## 📝 What Information Is Tracked

### Project Creation (`create_project` action)
```json
{
  "action": "create_project",
  "activity_type": "data_change",
  "project_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "creator-user-id",
  "user_name": "Creator Full Name",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T15:06:00.000Z",
  "details": {
    "project_title": "MrDIY Flagship Opening",
    "event_type": "Conference",
    "start_date": "2025-10-01",
    "end_date": "2025-10-05",
    "crew_count": 8,
    "created_by": "user-uuid",
    "creator_name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

### Database Fields
- `projects.created_by` - User ID who created the project
- `projects.created_at` - Timestamp of creation
- `activity_logs.user_id` - User who performed the action
- `activity_logs.user_name` - Display name of the user
- `activity_logs.details` - Additional context including creator name

## 🎯 Example Queries

### Find all projects created by a specific user
```sql
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.title,
  p.created_at,
  u.full_name as creator
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = p.created_by
WHERE p.created_by = 'user-uuid'
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

### Get creation timeline for all projects
```sql
SELECT
  p.title,
  p.created_at,
  u.full_name as created_by,
  p.status
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = p.created_by
WHERE p.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

### Find who created projects this month
```sql
SELECT
  u.full_name as creator,
  COUNT(*) as projects_created
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = p.created_by
WHERE p.created_at >= date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE)
  AND p.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY u.full_name
ORDER BY projects_created DESC;
```

## 🔄 Retroactive Updates

**Note:** Existing projects created before this implementation will have `created_by = NULL`.

To update them, you can:

### Option 1: Manual Update via SQL
```sql
-- If you know who created specific projects
UPDATE projects
SET created_by = 'known-user-id'
WHERE id = 'project-id';
```

### Option 2: Infer from Manager
```sql
-- Use manager as fallback for old projects
UPDATE projects
SET created_by = manager_id
WHERE created_by IS NULL
  AND manager_id IS NOT NULL;
```

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### Test 1: Create a New Project
1. Log in to your application
2. Create a new project through the UI
3. Check the database:
```sql
SELECT created_by, created_at FROM projects ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```
4. Verify creator ID is populated

### Test 2: View in UI
1. Open the newly created project
2. Navigate to the Spotlight Card
3. Look for "Created" section
4. Verify your name appears as creator

### Test 3: Check Activity Logs
```javascript
// In browser console
const logs = await activityLogger.getProjectLogs('project-id');
console.log('Creation log:', logs.find(l => l.action === 'create_project'));
```

     {creators.map(c => <SelectItem value={c.id}>{c.name}</SelectItem>)}
   </Select>
   ```

3. **Creator Dashboard**
   - Show stats: projects created, success rate, etc.
   - Timeline of creations
   - Team leaderboard

4. **Export Logs**
   ```typescript
   const exportCreationReport = async () => {
     const logs = await activityLogger.getProjectLogs();
     const csv = logs.filter(l => l.action === 'create_project')
       .map(l => `${l.details.project_title},${l.user_name},${l.timestamp}`)
       .join('\n');
     downloadCSV(csv, 'project-creations.csv');
   };
   ```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Creator not showing in UI
**Solution:**
- Check if `fetchProjects()` is being called
- Verify user is logged in when creating project
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: `created_by` is null for new projects
**Solution:**
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Check `getUser()` function returns valid user
- Verify database permissions allow user ID to be set

### Issue: Activity logs not recording
**Solution:**
- Check `activity_logs` table exists
- Verify RLS policies allow inserts
- Check browser console for logger errors
