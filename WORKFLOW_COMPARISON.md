# Workflow Comparison

## Your Required Workflow:
1. **Upload** → Excel/Receipt files
2. **Check Excel contains** → Sometimes has receipts (detection needed)
3. **Screenshot to AI** → Convert to images
4. **Reasoning** → AI analyzes structure and data
5. **Fill in data into masterlist** → Based on type/column mapping
6. **Verify** → Check if tables are correctly keyed in
7. **Modify with reasoning** → AI corrects mistakes
8. **Export** → Final output

## What We Built (Current Implementation):
1. ✅ **Upload** → Excel files ready in project root
2. ❌ **Check Excel contains** → NOT IMPLEMENTED (no receipt detection)
3. ✅ **Screenshot to AI** → PNG conversion with Pillow
4. ✅ **Reasoning** → Gemini analyzes structure, merged cells, continuation rows
5. ❌ **Fill in data into masterlist** → NOT IMPLEMENTED (saves to JSON only)
6. ❌ **Verify** → NOT IMPLEMENTED (no verification step)
7. ❌ **Modify with reasoning** → NOT IMPLEMENTED (no correction loop)
8. ❌ **Export** → NOT IMPLEMENTED (JSON output only, no Excel export)

## Missing Components:

### 1. Receipt Detection
- Need to detect if Excel contains receipt images
- Handle both tabular data and receipts separately

### 2. Masterlist Integration
- Map extracted data to correct columns in a master Excel/database
- Handle different table types (candidate info vs payment data)

### 3. Verification Step
- Cross-check extracted data against source
- Validate calculations (wages + OT + allowance = total)
- Detect duplicates and anomalies

### 4. Correction Loop
- AI reviews its own extraction
- Identifies and fixes errors with reasoning
- Re-validates after corrections

### 5. Export Functionality
- Export to Excel masterlist
- Export to Supabase database
- Generate summary reports

## Current Status:
**Step 3 & 4 Only** (Screenshot + AI Reasoning)

We successfully:
- ✅ Convert Excel to screenshots
- ✅ AI extraction with reasoning (51+ records)
- ✅ Handle merged cells, continuation rows
- ✅ Exclude summary rows

But we're missing:
- ❌ Receipt detection
- ❌ Masterlist integration
- ❌ Verification step
- ❌ Auto-correction
- ❌ Export to final format

## Next Steps to Complete Full Workflow:

1. Add receipt detection (OCR for images in Excel)
2. Create masterlist template or Supabase integration
3. Build verification module (validate extracted data)
4. Implement correction loop (AI reviews and fixes)
5. Add Excel/CSV export functionality
