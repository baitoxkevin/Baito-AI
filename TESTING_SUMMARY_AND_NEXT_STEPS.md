## 🔧 How to Continue Testing

### Option 1: Manual Testing (Current Approach)
**Time Required:** ~8-10 hours
**Accuracy:** High

**Steps:**
1. Open `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click "Open AI Assistant"
3. For each test in `AI_CHATBOT_100_TEST_SCENARIOS.md`:
   - Clear conversation
   - Send query
   - Wait for response
   - Verify tool used (look for "TOOLS:" in response)
   - Document result
4. Update `test-results-tracker.json`

### Option 2: Automated Testing (Recommended)
**Time Required:** 2-3 hours setup + 1 hour execution
**Accuracy:** Very High

**Steps:**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev playwright @playwright/test
   ```

2. Run automated test suite:
   ```bash
   node automated-chatbot-tester.js
   ```

3. Review `test-results-final.json`

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Balanced)
**Time Required:** ~4-5 hours
**Accuracy:** High

**Steps:**
1. Manually test Priority 1 categories (43 tests)
2. Document patterns and edge cases
3. Create automated tests for Priority 2-3
4. Run full automation suite
