# CC Stakeholder Implementation Summary (Updated)

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the CC (carbon copy) stakeholder functionality that allows projects to have multiple additional contacts from client companies and additional users beyond the main client company and person in charge.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
Created and updated migration:
- Added `cc_client_ids` (UUID array) to store company contact IDs (from company_contacts table)
- Added `cc_user_ids` (UUID array) to store additional user IDs
- Created indexes for better query performance
- Updated RLS policies to grant access to CC stakeholders
- Created `get_project_stakeholders()` function to retrieve all project stakeholders including contacts

### 2. EditProjectDialog Component
Updated `/src/components/EditProjectDialog.tsx`:
- Added CC fields to the form schema
- Created "Additional Stakeholders (CC)" section with multi-select UI
- Implemented searchable dropdowns using Command component
- Added badge display for selected CC stakeholders
- Updated form submission to include CC fields
- Fixed calendar popover closing issue (added `modal={true}`)

### 3. NewProjectDialog Component
Updated `/src/components/NewProjectDialog.tsx`:
- Added CC fields to the project schema
- Added "Additional Stakeholders (CC)" section in project-info step
- Implemented same multi-select UI as EditProjectDialog
- Updated form submission to include CC fields
- Added CC stakeholders display in the review step

### 4. UI Features
- **Multi-select dropdowns**: Searchable lists for selecting multiple contacts/users
- **Contact details**: Shows contact name, company, and designation for clarity
- **Badge display**: Selected stakeholders shown as removable badges with company info
- **Exclusion logic**: Main manager excluded from CC user selection
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indication of selected stakeholders
- **Modal popovers**: Fixed calendar closing issue with `modal={true}`

## How It Works

### For Users
1. When creating or editing a project, users see an "Additional Stakeholders (CC)" section
2. **CC Contacts**: Select specific contacts from any company (shows name, company, designation)
3. **CC Users**: Select additional team members to keep informed
4. Selected stakeholders appear as badges with company information
5. The main manager is automatically excluded from CC user list
6. CC stakeholders are displayed in the review step before project creation

### In the Database
- `cc_client_ids` stores company contact IDs (references company_contacts table)
- `cc_user_ids` stores user IDs (references users table)
- CC stakeholders are stored as UUID arrays in PostgreSQL
- RLS policies ensure proper access control
- GIN indexes provide efficient querying of array data

## Next Steps

### 1. âœ… Migration Applied
The migration has been successfully applied using Supabase MCP:
- CC columns added to projects table
- RLS policies updated
- Helper function created

### 2. Update Project Views
To complete the implementation, update these components to display CC stakeholders:
- `ProjectsPageRedesign`: Show CC indicators on project cards
- `SpotlightCard`: Display CC stakeholders in project details
- `ProjectDetailPage`: Show full CC stakeholder list

### 3. Notification System
The existing notification system will automatically include CC stakeholders since it uses the project's stakeholder data.

## Testing
1. Edit an existing project and add CC clients/users
2. Create a new project with CC stakeholders
3. Verify CC data is saved and displayed correctly
4. Check that CC stakeholders can view projects they're involved with

## Key Differences from Original Request
- **CC Clients = Company Contacts**: Instead of selecting other companies, users now select specific contacts from companies
- **Better Granularity**: Can CC specific people rather than entire companies
- **Contact Details**: Shows designation and company for each contact

## Benefits
- **Better Communication**: Keep specific contacts informed, not just companies
- **Flexible Organization**: Projects can involve multiple contacts from different companies
- **Clear Visibility**: See exactly which people are involved, not just companies
- **Contact Management**: Leverages existing company contacts structure
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to add more CC types in the future
